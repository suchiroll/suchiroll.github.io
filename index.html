		<h2> First things first </h2>
		<p> Hello! Welcome, welcome, get yourself comfortable, leave your shoes by the door. I'm Suchitra Natarajan, frequently known around the block as "Suchi". You can normally catch me going to work, attending local concerts, or walking my wiener dog Quincy, who you can follow over at his Instagram, <a id = "insta" href = "https://www.instagram.com/quincy_dachshund/" target = "_blank">located here.</a> I'm a hands-on frontend developer with experience in a number of web frameworks and design tools. I'm skilled in problem solving through open communication, data analysis, creative design, agile programming and teamwork and I've worked on a number of eCommerce, B2B Marketing and Digital Demand Orchestration projects.
		<p> Beyond programming, I'm passionate about art, design, and music. I'm somewhat of a connoisseur in bad movies and I love the weird and unexplained. I'm also an expert in Mario Kart: Double Dash. Feel free to contact me to chat! </p>
